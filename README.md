In this challenge we were given code to refactor (or clean) for a company called Horiseon.

At first glance the HTML code looked okay until I noticed that one of the links on the header wasn't redirecting to the correct part of the page. After locating the problem on line 29, I was able to give the code an id so it was able to link to the header
I also included a title for the webpage so that the tab read "Horiseon" instaed of "Untitled"
Since most of the images weren't of real value, I gave them an alt/title tag of " " and the main background title of "Horiseon"
The CSS coding needed to be consolidated on the .benefits div, h3 and imgs
I also consolidated the .content imgs and h2
I was also able to combine the stylings for the SEO and SMM sections

All of this was done to make the code look cleaner and function properly for the client.
